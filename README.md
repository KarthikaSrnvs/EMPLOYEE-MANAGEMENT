                                                Employee Management System (EMS)
This project is the development of an Employee Management System (EMS) aimed at organizing and controlling employee data management within an organization. The EMS provides a platform for managing employee information, including personal details, contact information, and job-related data. It incorporates role-based access control, ensuring secure and efficient management for both administrators and employees.

Features:

User Management: Login and manage profiles for administrators and employees.

Authentication & Authorization: Secure login and role-based access to features.

CRUD Operations: Admins can perform full CRUD operations on employee records, while employees can view and update their own details.

Responsive UI: A user-friendly interface built with HTML and CSS.

Backend: The systemâ€™s business logic and data management are handled by a Spring Boot application.

Database: Employee data is securely stored in PostgreSQL.
